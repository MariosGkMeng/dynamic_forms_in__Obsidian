# dynamic_forms_in__Obsidian
A dynamic form/essay/letter generator based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (which you'll need to **install** to use this tool).

# Prerequisites

## Install Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free, flexible note-taking tool that supports numerous capabilities. It is very "lightweight" (in terms of CPU), provides nices visualizations, connects notes with each other, runs commands and many other capabilities.

### Community plugins

You will need to **install and enable** the following community plugins:

1. Advanced Tables

Before you do so, make sure to deactivate safe-mode, so that community plugins can be activated (safe mode ensures that no plugin deletes your note files accidentally, which rarely happens).

### Learn the basics of Obsidian

Check the Help guide of Obsidian for that.

## Install Python

Install Python (preferably 3.7+)

### Install packages

1. numpy
2. os
3. re
4. subprocess
5. genericpath
6. turtle

For help on how to install those packages, check this [link](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing). _Install from pip_ is the quickest way to do so
